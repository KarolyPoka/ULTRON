# Data Augmentation Powered by Generative Adversarial Network
## Our goal
We would like to aim data augmentation with GAN network structure. The plan is to implement an extended InfoGAN structure which is capable to generate diverse face images by auto fine tuning appropriate latent parameters.

## Dataset
We are using the Celeba dataset and a significantly smaller dataset of Tony Stark to demonstrate the results. Our goal is to generate diverse images about Tony Stark for example different hair style, eye color etc.
1. Celeba dataset (200K images):
* 70% --> Training data
* 20% --> Test data
* 10% --> Validation data

2. TonyStark dataset:
* 100% for demonstaration
